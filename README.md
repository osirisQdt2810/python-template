## Setup environments:
```
    conda create -n template python==3.9
    conda activate template
```
To normally run the project, install package dependencies first:
```
    pip install pip-tool
```
by compiling `dev-requirements.in` to avoid package installation dependencies:
```
    pip-compile --strip-extras requirements/dev-requirements.in # --strip-extras flag controls <package>[extra] brackets are written into output dev-requirements.txt or not
```
Then, install dependencies:
```
    pip install -r requirements/dev-requirements.txt
```
## Install and build package:
### To install the project and its dependencies into your current Python environment:
Note that, you use this when you want to make your project's code importable, runnable and testable on your own machine:
```
    pip install -e .[dev,test]
```

### To distribute and create self-contained package files (.whl, .tar.gz)
Note that, you use this when use want to release your package. You are ready to share your code with others.
When you are finally ready to distribute your project to others, you can run the command that builds the .whl file you were originally looking for.
```
    pip install build
```
Run the build command:
```
    python -m build
```
This will create a `/dist` directory, and inside you will dinf your new `.whl` file, ready to be uploaded to PyPi.

### Journey to a beautiful python template project:
- First, use pip-compile to automatically generate requirements.txt dependencies from a high-level requirements.in file. This uses in step setup environment for running the code in development mode.
- Second, use pyproject.toml for building and installing our whole project to a package (that files also includes all the tools' configuration as well)
- Third, related to version control, when we want to commit/push current implementation, the code needa pass our pre-commit hooks (we could test our hooks by running commands: `pre-commit run --all-files --verbose`)
- Fourth, calculating the test coverage using `pytest --cov=src tests/`, the table will show:
  ```
  Name                              Stmts   Miss  Cover
  -----------------------------------------------------
  src/my_package/calculator.py         19      0   100%
  src/my_package/cli.py                32     32     0%
  -----------------------------------------------------
  TOTAL                                79     60    24%
  ```
  **Coverage Table Explanation:**
  - `Stmts`: Total executable code lines in each file
  - `Miss`: Number of lines NOT executed during tests  
  - `Cover`: Percentage of lines that were tested (Stmts - Miss) / Stmts * 100
  - **Professional goal**: Aim for 80%+ coverage, 90%+ is excellent
  - Use `pytest --cov=src --cov-report=term-missing tests/` to see which specific lines need testing
- Fifth, CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) automates testing, building, and deployment processes to ensure code quality and reliable releases

## CI/CD Implementation

### Introduction
CI/CD represents the backbone of modern software development workflows, automating the journey from code changes to production deployment. While pre-commit hooks provide immediate feedback during development, CI/CD creates comprehensive quality gates that protect your main branch and automate release processes.

### Purposes

**Why CI/CD is Essential:**
- **Quality Assurance**: Automatically run comprehensive tests across multiple environments
- **Early Bug Detection**: Catch integration issues before they reach production
- **Consistent Builds**: Ensure reproducible builds across different environments  
- **Automated Deployment**: Reduce human error in release processes
- **Team Collaboration**: Provide shared visibility into build status and quality metrics

**What CI/CD Provides:**
- **Continuous Integration (CI)**: Automated testing, linting, and building on every code change
- **Continuous Deployment (CD)**: Automated deployment to staging/production environments
- **Quality Gates**: Coverage thresholds, security scans, and performance checks
- **Artifact Management**: Build and store distributable packages
- **Notification Systems**: Alert teams about build failures or successful deployments

**When to Use CI/CD:**
- **Every repository**: Essential for professional development workflows
- **Team projects**: Critical for coordination and quality assurance
- **Production systems**: Mandatory for reliable deployment processes
- **Open source projects**: Provides transparency and builds trust with contributors

### Pipeline Stages

Our CI/CD pipeline includes the following stages:

1. **Code Quality Checks**: Linting, formatting, type checking
2. **Testing**: Unit tests, integration tests, coverage analysis
3. **Security Scanning**: Dependency vulnerability checks
4. **Build**: Package creation and validation
5. **Release**: Automated deployment to staging/production

### CI/CD Workflow Example

Our GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) implements the following professional pipeline:

```yaml
# Trigger on pushes to main/develop and all pull requests
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, develop ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]
  workflow_dispatch:  # Manual trigger
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 2 * * 0'  # Weekly security scans
```

**Pipeline Jobs:**

1. **üîç Code Quality Checks** (`code-quality`)
   - Ruff formatting check: `ruff format --check --diff .`
   - Ruff linting: `ruff check --output-format=github .`
   - MyPy type checking: `mypy src/ --install-types --non-interactive`
   - Docstring validation: `docformatter --check --recursive src/`

2. **üß™ Test Suite Matrix** (`test`)
   - Multi-version testing: Python 3.9, 3.10, 3.11
   - Multi-OS testing: Ubuntu, Windows, macOS  
   - Coverage analysis: `pytest --cov=src --cov-fail-under=80`
   - Coverage reporting: XML, HTML, JSON formats
   - Upload to Codecov for analysis

3. **üîí Security Scanning** (`security`)
   - Dependency vulnerabilities: `safety check`
   - Static code analysis: `bandit -r src/`
   - Security report artifacts

4. **üèóÔ∏è Build & Package** (`build`)
   - Create wheel and source distributions: `python -m build`
   - Validate packages: `twine check dist/*`
   - Store artifacts for deployment

5. **üöÄ Deployment** (`deploy`)
   - Conditional: Only on tagged releases (`refs/tags/v*`)
   - Deploy to PyPI: `pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish@release/v1`
   - Protected environment with manual approval

6. **üìä Reporting** (`report`)
   - Aggregate pipeline results
   - Generate summary with metrics
   - Provide actionable failure insights

### Coverage Integration in CI/CD

**Why Coverage Belongs in CI/CD (Not Pre-commit):**
- **Comprehensive Analysis**: CI/CD runs full test suite across multiple environments
- **Quality Gates**: Prevents merging code below coverage thresholds
- **Historical Tracking**: Monitors coverage trends over time
- **Team Visibility**: Shared coverage reports for all contributors
- **Performance**: Avoids slowing down individual commits

**Coverage Configuration** (`pyproject.toml`):
```toml
[tool.coverage.run]
source = ["src"]
branch = true                    # Enable branch coverage
omit = ["*/tests/*", "*/venv/*"] # Exclude test files

[tool.coverage.report]
fail_under = 80                  # Quality gate threshold
show_missing = true              # Show uncovered lines
exclude_lines = [                # Exclude defensive code
    "pragma: no cover",
    "raise NotImplementedError",
    "if __name__ == .__main__.:"
]
```

**Coverage Commands:**
```bash
# Basic coverage report
pytest --cov=src tests/

# Detailed coverage with missing lines
pytest --cov=src --cov-report=term-missing tests/

# Generate HTML report for detailed analysis
pytest --cov=src --cov-report=html tests/

# Fail if coverage below threshold
pytest --cov=src --cov-fail-under=80 tests/

# Generate all report formats (CI/CD)
pytest --cov=src --cov-report=term-missing --cov-report=xml --cov-report=html tests/
```

**Advanced Coverage Analysis:**
```bash
# Use custom coverage script for detailed analysis
python scripts/coverage_report.py

# Set custom threshold
python scripts/coverage_report.py --threshold 90

# View coverage history and trends
python scripts/coverage_report.py history
```

### Professional CI/CD Best Practices

**Quality Gates:**
- ‚úÖ All code quality checks must pass
- ‚úÖ Test coverage must meet 80% threshold
- ‚úÖ Security scans must show no high-severity vulnerabilities
- ‚úÖ All tests must pass across Python versions
- ‚úÖ Package build must succeed

**Branch Protection:**
- Require status checks before merge
- Require up-to-date branches
- Require linear history
- Restrict pushes to main branch

**Deployment Strategy:**
- **Feature branches**: Run full CI pipeline
- **Pull requests**: Run CI + security scans
- **Main branch**: Run CI + build artifacts
- **Tagged releases**: Run CI + deploy to production

**Monitoring and Alerts:**
- Build status notifications via email/Slack
- Coverage reports uploaded to Codecov
- Security vulnerability alerts
- Deployment status notifications
